#### Preface:

In relation to [Creating Multiple Site Headers](https://github.com/JRVarsity/VS-Documentation/blob/main/Creating%20Multiple%20Site%20Headers.md) and [Creating Multiple Site Footers](https://github.com/JRVarsity/VS-Documentation/blob/main/Creating%20Multiple%20Site%20Footers.md), a unique sections may need to go on a number of different related pages/templates, and in the case of unique headers and footers for site partitioning, this will always be the case.

Upon saving the theme from the customizer when you create and modify a new section on a page template, Shopify automatically generates a unique ID for that specific section on that specific template. Creating that same section with the same settings on a different page template will result in a different unique ID every time. In order to keep things organized, and CSS all in one place, we're going to copy the unique ID for these sections and paste them into the JSON of any other template or page we want to use them on. This alleviates the need of the theme customizer for these sections that are more "global" to our site and will preserve the unique ID for easy CSS customization wherever these unique sections are used.
